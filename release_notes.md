## Release Process Recommendations

### Current Process Strengths
‚úÖ **Automated tooling**: `tools/make-release.sh` script handles git tagging and GitHub releases  
‚úÖ **Version synchronization**: Automatic sync between package.json and src/version.js  
‚úÖ **Pre-flight checks**: Validates git status, authentication, and branch  
‚úÖ **Manual npm publish**: Prevents accidental publishes with dry-run preview  

### Recommended Improvements

#### 1. **Integrate Release Notes Updates**
```bash
# Add to tools/make-release.sh before creating GitHub release:
./tools/update-release-notes.sh "$VERSION" "$CUSTOM_NOTES"
```

#### 2. **Create Automated Release Notes Script**
Create `tools/update-release-notes.sh`:
- Parse git commits since last tag using conventional commit format
- Auto-categorize changes (NEW/IMPROVED/FIXED/BREAKING)
- Update release_notes.md with structured entry
- Validate release notes format

#### 3. **Enforce Conventional Commits**
- Add commit message validation via git hooks
- Use format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Enable automated changelog generation

#### 4. **Enhanced Pre-release Validation**
Add to prerelease process:
- ‚úÖ Run full test suite (already included)
- ‚úÖ Build all targets (already included)  
- ‚ûï Validate documentation links
- ‚ûï Check for breaking changes
- ‚ûï Validate release notes entry exists
- ‚ûï Run CLI integration tests

#### 5. **Release Checklist Integration**
Create `tools/release-checklist.md` with:
- [ ] Update package.json version
- [ ] Add release notes entry
- [ ] Run `npm run prerelease`
- [ ] Run `./tools/make-release.sh "notes"`
- [ ] Test npm package locally
- [ ] Publish to npm
- [ ] Update documentation deployment

#### 6. **Automated Documentation Deployment**
- Trigger docs rebuild on release
- Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
- Update live demo links
- Validate all examples work with new version

### Implementation Priority
1. **HIGH**: Release notes automation (immediate impact)
2. **MEDIUM**: Conventional commits (improves changelog quality)
3. **LOW**: Enhanced validation (nice to have, already quite robust)
