# SquibView Release Notes

Complete changelog and release history for SquibView.

---

## v1.0.20 

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed list bullet positioning** - List bullets (ul/ol) now properly display within the content area instead of appearing in the left margin/gutter. Added explicit CSS rules for list padding and margins in `.squibview-output`.
- **Fixed CSS bundling issue** - Removed external CSS imports (highlight.js, leaflet) from standalone build. These styles are now loaded dynamically via the autoload feature, reducing dist/squibview.css from 1400 to 645 lines.
- **Fixed release tools** - Updated `make-release.sh` and `update-release-notes.sh` to use `docs/release-notes.md` instead of root directory

### ‚ú® Improvements
- **Cleaner CSS distribution** - Core squibview.css now contains only SquibView styles. External library styles load on-demand.
- **Better theme flexibility** - Users can now provide custom highlight.js themes without conflicts

### üß™ Testing
- Added unit test for list rendering structure validation

- Added JSDoc comments to all functions and key attributes in headless example

#### Documentation Updates
- **API Methods Reference** - Corrected method names and signatures in `docs/api/methods.md`

- **Headless Mode Guide** - Updated all code examples with correct API usage in `docs/guides/headless-mode.md`
- Added standard favicon to headless example

#### API Corrections
- `undo()`/`redo()` ‚Üí `revisionUndo()`/`revisionRedo()`
- `getRevisionCount()` ‚Üí `revisionNumRevsions()`
- `getRenderedHTML()` ‚Üí `getHTMLSource()`
- `copyToClipboard(format)` ‚Üí `copySource()` or `copyHTML()`
- Event access via `editor.events.on()` not `editor.on()`
- Event names use colons: `content:change`, `text:selected`, `revision:undo`
