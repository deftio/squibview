# SquibView

[Live Demo (github)](https://deftio.github.io/squibview/examples/example_ESM.html)

[Live Demo (local)](./examples/example_ESM.html)

SquibView is a javascript embeddable for converting GitHub-flavored Markdown (or full HTML pages) into a rendered view on the fly. 

For markdown inputs, it supports rendering Mermaid diagrams, syntax-highlighted code blocks, tables, and inline SVG graphics, providing a powerful and interactive way to view and export your Markdown content as HTML.

For HTML inputs, it creates a complete embedded iframe to view the content.  

## Web Viewer

SquibView can be used as a standalone tool for taking complex markdown output (such as from OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, or Deepseek) or a simple live preview markdown editor.  

## As a Component

Squibview also can be used as an embedddable component in your app, where you can feed it complex markdown or other content and then render it on the fly.  Squibview can dynamically switch between showing a splitscreen of both the source and output or just the output so one can use it as renderer.  

### Using via CDN

Squibview is available on unpkg and npm.  

## Examples

See the [examples folder](./examples)

## Features

- **Live Preview**: See the rendered HTML output in real-time as you edit your Markdown.
- **Multiple Views**: Switch between Markdown editor, HTML preview, or split view using simple buttons.
- **Graphical Support**: Render Mermaid diagrams, inline SVG graphics, and other visual formats directly from Markdown.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks are automatically highlighted using Highlight.js.
