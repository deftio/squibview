# SquibView v1.0.15 Build Clean-ups Task List

## Overview
Version 1.0.15 will focus on simplifying the build system and improving the developer experience by bundling core dependencies and making examples more consistent and easier to follow.

**Key Strategy**: Maintain backwards compatibility by updating existing builds to include markdown-it rather than creating new filenames. This ensures existing applications continue to work without changes while automatically fixing import map issues.

## Core Changes

### 1. Build Updates
- [ ] Update existing `squibview.esm.min.js` to include bundled core dependencies (~240KB)
  - [ ] Bundle markdown-it (~99KB)
  - [ ] Bundle diff-match-patch (~15KB)
  - [ ] Bundle tiny-emitter (~2KB)
  - [ ] Keep eventemitter3, papaparse, turndown as external (less critical, larger)
- [ ] Update existing `squibview.umd.min.js` with same bundled deps
- [ ] Create new `squibview.esm-lean.min.js` - Current lean build (141KB)
- [ ] Create new `squibview.umd-lean.min.js` - Current lean build (147KB)
- [ ] Create `squibview.standalone.umd.min.js` as alias/copy of `squibview.standalone.min.js`
- [ ] Update rollup.config.js with new build targets

### 2. Build Naming & Organization
Updated strategy for backwards compatibility:
- `squibview.esm.min.js` - **UPDATED**: Now includes bundled markdown-it (~240KB) - Default
- `squibview.esm-lean.min.js` - **NEW**: Lean ESM without deps (141KB) - For advanced users
- `squibview.umd.min.js` - **UPDATED**: Now includes bundled markdown-it (~250KB) - Default
- `squibview.umd-lean.min.js` - **NEW**: Lean UMD without deps (147KB) - For advanced users
- `squibview.standalone.min.js` - Everything bundled (3.7MB) → Keep for backwards compatibility
- `squibview.standalone.umd.min.js` - **NEW**: Same as above but with clear naming
- `squibview.standalone.esm.min.js` - Already exists with clear naming

Note: `squibview.standalone.min.js` is UMD but doesn't have it in the name. Keep for backwards compatibility but use clearer names going forward.

### 3. Example Updates

#### Archive Examples Not in index.html
- [ ] Create `examples/archive/` directory
- [ ] Move all examples not listed in `examples/index.html` to archive
- [ ] Add README.md to archive explaining these are unmaintained/unvetted

#### Update Existing Examples
- [ ] `example_ESM.html` → Use `squibview.esm.min.js`, remove import maps
- [ ] `example_standalone.html` → Keep using standalone (this is its purpose)
- [ ] `example_umd.html` → Use `squibview.umd.min.js`, remove markdown-it script tags
- [ ] `example_react.html` → Use appropriate min build (not standalone)
- [ ] `example_vue.html` → Use appropriate min build (not standalone)
- [ ] `diff_view_live.html` → Use `squibview.esm.min.js`, remove import maps
- [ ] `diff_view_inline.html` → Use `squibview.esm.min.js`, remove import maps
- [ ] **Review all examples** - Ensure none use standalone builds except standalone examples

#### New Examples
- [ ] `example_ESM_lean.html` - Show how to use lean build with import maps
- [ ] `example_bundler.html` - Show webpack/vite integration with lean builds
- [ ] `quickstart.html` - Dead simple example with bundled ESM

#### Example Consistency Checklist
- [ ] ESM examples use `<script type="module">` and `import`
- [ ] UMD examples use regular `<script>` tags
- [ ] Each example clearly states which build it uses
- [ ] No mixing of loading styles (e.g., no script tags + import maps)
- [ ] Comments explain why this build was chosen
- [ ] **No examples use standalone builds except those specifically demonstrating standalone**

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- [ ] Update Quick Start - no changes needed (default builds now include markdown-it)
- [ ] Add "Which Build Should I Use?" decision tree
- [ ] Update CDN examples - should work without import maps now
- [ ] Add section explaining the different builds
- [ ] Add migration note: "v1.0.15+ includes markdown-it bundled by default"

#### Build Guide (new doc)
- [ ] Create `docs/build-guide.md` explaining all builds
- [ ] Size comparison table
- [ ] Use case for each build
- [ ] Migration guide from v1.0.14

### 5. Package.json & Build Scripts
- [ ] Update version to 1.0.15
- [ ] Update existing build scripts to bundle markdown-it by default:
  - `build:esm` - Now builds with bundled deps
  - `build:umd` - Now builds with bundled deps
- [ ] Add new build scripts for lean versions:
  - `build:esm-lean` - Build without deps
  - `build:umd-lean` - Build without deps
- [ ] Update `build:all` to include lean targets
- [ ] Ensure npm publish includes all new build files in dist/
- [ ] Update .gitignore if needed to exclude any build artifacts

### 5a. Build Process Cleanup
- [ ] Fix specific warnings during `npm run build:all`:
  - [ ] **Missing shims for Node.js built-ins** - UMD builds depend on "stream"
    - Add rollup-plugin-polyfill-node to UMD config
  - [ ] **Missing global variable names** - stream module needs output.globals config
  - [ ] **Circular dependencies** in d3-selection (28+ warnings)
    - Investigate if we can update/patch d3-selection or suppress warnings
  - [ ] **BABEL deoptimization** - Three.js files exceed 500KB
    - Consider excluding Three.js from babel transformation
  - [ ] **CLI import path warning** - Expected different path for CLI
- [ ] Make build output cleaner:
  - [ ] Suppress repetitive warnings (e.g., show circular deps once, not 28 times)
  - [ ] Add `onwarn` handler in rollup.config.js to filter warnings
  - [ ] Show summary at end (files created, sizes, time taken)
- [ ] Consider build optimizations:
  - [ ] Skip source maps for minified builds to speed up build time
  - [ ] Add `--silent` flag option for CI builds
  - [ ] Parallelize build targets where possible

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Add tests to verify bundled builds work without import maps
- [ ] Test that lean builds still work with proper setup
- [ ] E2E test for each example file
- [ ] Verify no regression in bundle sizes

### 7. Migration & Breaking Changes
- [ ] No breaking changes - all existing builds remain
- [ ] Add console warning in lean builds if deps missing?
- [ ] Create migration guide for v1.0.14 → v1.0.15
- [ ] Handle double-loading gracefully:
  - [ ] Test with external markdown-it already loaded
  - [ ] Ensure no conflicts or errors (bundled version isolated from global)
  - [ ] Document that external markdown-it script tags can be removed but aren't required to be
  - [ ] Bundled markdown-it should be completely internal to SquibView (no global pollution)
  - [ ] Test both scenarios: with and without external markdown-it

### 8. Library Warning Improvements
- [ ] Remove console warnings when libraries (Leaflet, Three.js, etc.) are not loaded
- [ ] Only show warnings when actually encountering content that needs them
- [ ] Change behavior:
  - Current: Warns on initialization if libraries missing
  - New: Only warn when finding a `geojson`, `topojson`, `stl` fence block
- [ ] Keep the placeholder message in the rendered output
- [ ] Consider single warning per library per session (not per block)

## Build Targets Summary

| Build File | Type | Size | Dependencies | Purpose |
|------------|------|------|--------------|---------|
| `squibview.esm.min.js` | ESM | ~240KB | Bundled: markdown-it, diff-match-patch, tiny-emitter | **Default ESM build** - Works out of the box, no import maps needed |
| `squibview.esm-lean.min.js` | ESM | 141KB | None (all external) | Advanced users with bundlers or existing deps |
| `squibview.umd.min.js` | UMD | ~250KB | Bundled: markdown-it, diff-match-patch, tiny-emitter | **Default UMD build** - Works with script tags, no extra deps |
| `squibview.umd-lean.min.js` | UMD | 147KB | None (all external) | Advanced users who manage dependencies |
| `squibview.standalone.min.js` | UMD* | 3.7MB | Everything bundled | Legacy name - kept for backwards compatibility |
| `squibview.standalone.umd.min.js` | UMD | 3.7MB | Everything bundled | **NEW** - Clear naming for UMD standalone |
| `squibview.standalone.esm.min.js` | ESM | 3.7MB | Everything bundled | ESM version with all features |

*Note: `squibview.standalone.min.js` is UMD format but lacks clear naming. Use `squibview.standalone.umd.min.js` for new projects.

### Dependency Details
**Core deps (bundled in default builds):**
- markdown-it (~99KB) - Required for markdown parsing
- diff-match-patch (~15KB) - Required for revision history
- tiny-emitter (~2KB) - Required for event system

**Optional deps (only in standalone):**
- mermaid (~2.5MB) - Diagram rendering
- three.js (~600KB) - 3D model rendering  
- leaflet (~150KB) - Map rendering
- mathjax (~300KB) - Math equations
- turndown (~40KB) - HTML to Markdown
- papaparse (~20KB) - CSV parsing

## Implementation Order
1. Create bundled build configs in rollup
2. Test bundled builds work properly
3. Update examples to use bundled builds
4. Create new lean examples
5. Update documentation
6. Test everything
7. Release

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Examples Audit
Currently using lean ESM (need import maps):
- `example_ESM.html` - Uses `squibview.esm.min.js` with import maps
- `diff_view_live.html` - Uses `squibview.esm.js` with import maps  
- `diff_view_inline.html` - Uses `squibview.esm.js` with import maps

Currently using standalone (many should be changed to min builds):
- `debug_constructor.html` - standalone.umd → Should use min build?
- `selection_api_complete.html` - standalone.umd.min → Should use min build
- `plugin_system.html` - standalone.umd.min → Should use min build
- `example_selection_api.html` - standalone.esm → Should use esm.min
- `example_UMD_cdn.html` - standalone.umd.min (CDN) → Keep (shows CDN standalone)
- `standalone_cdn.html` - standalone.umd.min (CDN) → Keep (explicit standalone demo)
- `standalone_esm.html` - standalone.esm.min → Keep (explicit standalone demo)
- `lock_unlock_demo.html` - standalone.umd.min → Should use min build
- `example_csv.html` - standalone.esm.min → Should use esm.min (CSV is in core)
- `example_ESM_cdn.html` - standalone.esm.min (CDN) → Should use esm.min CDN
- `standalone_umd.html` - standalone.umd.min → Keep (explicit standalone demo)

Currently using lean UMD (need script tags):
- `example_umd.html` - Uses `squibview.umd.min.js` with script tags

Framework examples:
- `example_vue.html` - Uses vue build → Should verify not using standalone
- `example_react.html` - Uses react build → Should verify not using standalone

### Key Problems to Solve
1. ESM examples require complex import maps
2. No clear guidance on when to use which build
3. Mixing of build types in examples
4. New users hit import errors immediately
5. Console warnings for missing libraries even when not needed
6. **Bandwidth waste** - Many examples use 3.7MB standalone builds when 240KB min builds would work
7. **Unclear naming** - `standalone.min.js` doesn't indicate it's UMD format

## Discussion Points (Resolved)
1. ~~Should we rename current builds to include "-lean" suffix?~~ → No, keep existing names for backwards compatibility
2. ~~Should bundled be the default export from package.json?~~ → Yes, existing builds will now include markdown-it
3. ~~Do we need both ESM and UMD bundled versions?~~ → Yes, update both default builds
4. Should we show deprecation notice on import map errors? → Not needed, errors will disappear
5. What about TypeScript definitions for bundled builds? → No changes needed
6. Should warnings be once-per-session or once-per-block-type?
7. Should we track which libraries were warned about to avoid duplicates?
8. ~~How to handle users who already include markdown-it externally?~~ → **Keep bundled version isolated to avoid conflicts**
   - Bundle markdown-it in a way that doesn't conflict with global versions
   - No namespace collisions - bundled version is internal to SquibView
   - Users can safely have both external and bundled versions
   - Priority: **No errors** over optimization

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Rollup Config Updates
```javascript
// Updated default ESM build (now with bundled deps)
{
  input: 'src/squibview.js',
  output: {
    file: 'dist/squibview.esm.min.js',  // Same filename!
    format: 'es',
    sourcemap: true
  },
  external: [
    // Only exclude non-critical deps
    'eventemitter3',
    'papaparse', 
    'turndown'
  ],
  plugins: [
    nodeResolve(),
    commonjs(),
    // Bundle these critical deps:
    // - markdown-it (isolated, won't conflict with global version)
    // - diff-match-patch  
    // - tiny-emitter
    // Important: Configure bundling to avoid global namespace pollution
  ]
}

// New lean ESM build (current behavior)
{
  input: 'src/squibview.js',
  output: {
    file: 'dist/squibview.esm-lean.min.js',
    format: 'es',
    sourcemap: true
  },
  external: [
    // All deps external (current behavior)
    'markdown-it',
    'diff-match-patch',
    'tiny-emitter',
    'eventemitter3',
    'papaparse', 
    'turndown'
  ]
}
```

### Example Usage After Implementation
```html
<!-- Before (v1.0.14) - Complex! -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/markdown-it/12.3.2/markdown-it.min.js"></script>
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "markdown-it": "https://esm.sh/markdown-it@12.3.2"
  }
}
</script>
<script type="module">
  import SquibView from 'https://unpkg.com/squibview/dist/squibview.esm.min.js';
</script>

<!-- After (v1.0.15) - Simple! -->
<script type="module">
  import SquibView from 'https://unpkg.com/squibview/dist/squibview.esm-bundled.min.js';
  // Just works! No import map needed!
</script>
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No import map configuration needed for basic usage
- [ ] Examples are self-contained and consistent
- [ ] Clear documentation on which build to use when
- [ ] **No breaking changes** - Existing apps work without any code changes
- [ ] Import map errors automatically resolved for existing users

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Safe Build Updates (Priority: HIGH, Risk: MEDIUM)
**Goal**: Add bundled markdown-it to default builds without breaking anything

- [ ] Create feature branch `v1.0.15-bundled-builds`
- [ ] Backup current `rollup.config.js` as `rollup.config.backup.js`
- [ ] Update rollup config to bundle markdown-it in default builds:
  - [ ] Test ESM build locally
  - [ ] Test UMD build locally
  - [ ] Verify all existing examples still work
- [ ] Create lean build variants:
  - [ ] Add `build:esm-lean` script
  - [ ] Add `build:umd-lean` script
  - [ ] Test lean builds match current behavior
- [ ] Run full test suite after each change
- [ ] **HOLD POINT**: Test all examples manually before proceeding

### Phase 2: Example Updates (Priority: HIGH, Risk: LOW)
**Goal**: Update examples to use appropriate builds

- [ ] Create `examples/archive/` directory
- [ ] Move unused examples to archive (check against index.html)
- [ ] Update active examples to remove import maps:
  - [ ] `example_ESM.html`
  - [ ] `diff_view_live.html`
  - [ ] `diff_view_inline.html`
- [ ] Update examples using standalone builds unnecessarily:
  - [ ] Test each example after updating
  - [ ] Document which build each uses
- [ ] **HOLD POINT**: Verify all examples in index.html work

### Phase 3: Library Warnings (Priority: MEDIUM, Risk: LOW)
**Goal**: Only warn when content needs missing libraries

- [ ] Find where library warnings are triggered
- [ ] Add conditional checks before warnings
- [ ] Test with content that needs each library
- [ ] Ensure warnings still appear when needed
- [ ] **HOLD POINT**: Test various content types

### Phase 4: Build Cleanup (Priority: LOW, Risk: MEDIUM)
**Goal**: Clean up build warnings without breaking builds

- [ ] Document all current warnings (already done above)
- [ ] Create `rollup.config.cleanup.js` for testing fixes
- [ ] Fix one warning type at a time:
  - [ ] Test after each fix
  - [ ] Revert if anything breaks
- [ ] Only merge cleanup if all builds still work
- [ ] **HOLD POINT**: Full regression test

### Phase 5: Documentation & Release
**Goal**: Update docs and prepare release

- [ ] Update README.md with build information
- [ ] Create migration guide in release notes
- [ ] Update package.json to 1.0.15
- [ ] Run `npm run build:all`
- [ ] Run `npm run test:all`
- [ ] Create release PR
- [ ] **HOLD POINT**: Final review before merge

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
Before starting ANY implementation:
- [ ] Current build process works (`npm run build:all` succeeds)
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test:all`)
- [ ] Create full backup of working state
- [ ] Document current build output sizes for comparison
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready

### Testing Checklist
After EACH phase:
- [ ] `npm run build:all` completes without errors
- [ ] `npm run test:all` passes
- [ ] All examples in `examples/index.html` work
- [ ] No console errors in examples
- [ ] Build sizes are reasonable (no 10x increases)
- [ ] Can import in both Node and browser environments

### Rollback Plan
If anything breaks:
- [ ] `git checkout rollup.config.backup.js rollup.config.js`
- [ ] `git checkout package.json`
- [ ] `npm install`
- [ ] `npm run build:all`
- [ ] Investigate issue in isolated test branch
