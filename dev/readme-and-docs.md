# SquibView README and Documentation Improvement Plan

## Overview
The current README.md and documentation needs a complete overhaul to be more engaging, compact, professional, and effective at communicating SquibView's value proposition without being braggy or verbose.

## Core Problems Identified

### README.md Issues
1. **Too verbose and scattered** - Content is all over the place with no clear flow
2. **Takes too long to get to the point** - Doesn't hook readers quickly
3. **Hero section problems**:
   - Current example screenshot takes up massive space before the fold
   - Doesn't show rich content capabilities (tables, math, complex diagrams)
   - Generic and not compelling
4. **Braggy tone** - Comparison tables and competitive language ("vs Others")
5. **Poor information hierarchy** - Important info buried, less important stuff prominent
6. **Excessive whitespace and sections** - Makes it feel longer than necessary
7. **Missing key use cases** - Doesn't clearly show who should use this and why

### Documentation Structure Issues
1. **Fragmented docs** - Information scattered across multiple files
2. **Poor discoverability** - Hard to find specific information
3. **Inconsistent examples** - Examples don't flow together coherently
4. **Missing progressive complexity** - No clear learning path

### Technical Issues
1. **index.html rendering** - CSS and layout problems
2. **Example organization** - Examples don't tell a coherent story
3. **Build documentation** - Confusing size/format information
